# Batch Autowire Hiccup

Exhibits behavior of Autowiring JobBuilderFactory in 2.6.0.M2 causes circular bean reference.

## Notes:
* Removing the DataSource will prevent the circular reference exception
* Passing the  JobBuilderFactory and StepBuilderFactory beans via the constructor  will prevent the circular reference.

## Build

```
mvn clean package
```
